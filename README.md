# üè† House Price Prediction

A Machine Learning Project to Predict House Prices Based on Key Features

---

## Description

This project aims to accurately predict house prices using a variety of features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, year built, and more. Leveraging machine learning models like **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**, the project demonstrates how data science can provide actionable insights for real estate pricing.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Suhours/House-prediction-dataset.git
   cd House-prediction-dataset
   ```

2. **Set up the Python environment:**
   - It's recommended to use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) for an isolated environment.
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

---

## Dataset

- The dataset contains comprehensive information on houses, including features relevant to price prediction.
- **Source:** [Add dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle or UCI]
- **Size:** [Add number of records, e.g., 10,000 rows √ó 8 features]
- The data has been cleaned and preprocessed for modeling.

---

## Features

The most important features used for prediction include:

- **Size_sqft**: Total living area in square feet
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms (full/half)
- **YearBuilt**: Year the house was constructed
- **Location**: Geographic area or neighborhood
- **LotSize**: Lot size in square feet
- **Garage**: Presence and size of garage
- **Other Features**: e.g., presence of a pool, proximity to schools

---

## Model

Several machine learning models were explored, with a focus on:

- **Linear Regression**: For its simplicity and interpretability
- **Random Forest Regressor**: For its ability to model non-linear relationships and handle feature interactions

**Preprocessing Steps:**
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler)
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., One-Hot Encoding for 'Location')
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

---

## Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **R¬≤ Score** (Coefficient of Determination)

**Sample Results:**
```text
Random Forest:
  - RMSE: 32,000
  - MAE: 24,000
  - R¬≤: 0.85

Linear Regression:
  - RMSE: 38,000
  - MAE: 29,000
  - R¬≤: 0.78
```
*(Replace with actual results from your experiments)*

## Usage

To run the prediction script:

```bash
python predict.py --input sample_input.csv --output results.csv
```

**Example: Making predictions on new data**
```python
from model import load_model, predict_price

model = load_model('trained_model.pkl')
sample_data = {
    'Size_sqft': 2000,
    'Bedrooms': 3,
    'Bathrooms': 2,
    'YearBuilt': 2010,
    'Location': 'Downtown',
    # ... other features
}
predicted_price = predict_price(model, sample_data)
print(f"Predicted house price: ${predicted_price:,.2f}")
```

---

## Results

- The **Random Forest model** achieved the highest accuracy with an R¬≤ score of 0.85, indicating strong predictive power.
- Key insights:
  - Location and size are the most influential features.
  - Adding more granular location data could further improve accuracy.
- The model generalizes well on test data and provides robust price estimates for new listings.

## Future Work

- üèóÔ∏è Integrate more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- üåê Develop a web interface for interactive predictions
- üìà Incorporate additional features such as crime rates, nearby amenities, or school ratings
- üîÑ Automate data updates with real-time housing market data
